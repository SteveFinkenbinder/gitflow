**Very General &amp; Broad Overview of GitHub Collaboration Process**

Below is a broad 10 step approach to collaborating on projects with Git and GitHub. This approach is not the end all be all, but is one that I have found to be useful and easy to understand for the very small amount of projects I have worked on (thus far).

Also, what better place to document and track this than GitHub? ðŸ˜‰

##Follow the Organization/Person

- Star and Watch the repository
- Become a member of the organization

The items above will help make it easier to stay up to date on what's going on with that organization or person. It is especially important to receive notification to learn about Git merges from pull requests, as these merges and pull requests may or may not impact your own work and contributions to the repository.
